## Instructions

1) Open the `iACC.xcodeproj` project on Xcode 13.0 or higher.

	- Older Xcode versions are not supported.
	- Beta Xcode versions are not supported.

2) The project already comes with tests. Throughout the refactoring, run all tests with CMD+U after changing the code.

3) Commit every time you make a change, and the tests pass. This way, you have a working state to revert to if needed.

	- If a test fails, a behavior of the system is broken. Revert your changes to the previous commit with all tests passing and try again.

4) The project should build without warnings.

5) The code should be carefully organized and easy to read (e.g., indentation must be consistent).

Happy coding!
